monolith and microservice architecture

monolith - have api, ui, auth ,db conectivity inside same project
to change any minute thing have to build and compile the whole project

microservice - different service for different jobs, small services combine together form a big app, know as *seperation of concerns* and *single responsibility principle*
how do these services interact with each other -  all services run on their specific port - services interact by making a call to different service

how react talk to diff microservice
how to do api call, 2 ways :
1) as soon as page loads, we can make a call to api and fetch the data and when we get data then render to ui
loads -> api  call -> render
2) as soon as page loads, we render ui and then make api call, adn as soon as we get data we re-render the data
loads -> render -> api call 
we will use this in React , better ux
we are rendering twice, but reacts render cycles are very fast beacuse of which we do not face problem


useEffect - the callback function in useEffect is called after the component is rendered, as sson as render cycle is finished the the callback func is called

why we need state variables - state variables are used so that we can re-render component
when state updating fucntion called, then react will re-render componenet and all updated values will be there ie it triggers a reconciliton cycle runs

how const state variable value changes  - when re-render happens then the compoenent is called again and then a new state variable is created with the updated value
