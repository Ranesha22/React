jsx and react are not same
jsx is not html inside js


jsx - html/XML like syntax 
js engine cannot read jsx
parcel is doing the job behind the scene 
before the code goes to js engine , it is transpiled and then js engine receives code that broswer can understand
transpiling is done by parcel which in turn uses babel to transpile
jsx is transpiled to react.createelement which is an js object and rendered as html
babel is converting jsx to react.createelement

elemts returned using jsx is same as elemets cretaed using normal react

to use class we need to use className
if you want to write multiple lines - need to wrap in ()

React Component 
- 1) class based - old way
- 2) functioanl comp - new way

React Func Comp - is a normal js functioanl which returns some jsx elemets
- name it with capital letter

you can write any js code within { } inside a jsx

jsx takes care of injection attacks(cross site scripting attack)
