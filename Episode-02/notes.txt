to make production ready - not just react but there are other packages as weel.

//make your own production ready code

npm is everything but node package manager
npm manages packages but does not stand for nde package amnager
npm is a repo for all packages - all packages are hosted here - any package you need to include you can find here and install

//add npm -
 step 1 - npm init
 step 2 - give details
 package.json - configuration for npm, track of what version of package is installed (approx version)
 why do we need - packages are also known as dependencies ,
 our project depends on theses, npm takes care of all these versions

we need to install a bundler - bundles,packages app so that it can be shipped to production
create-react-app uses webpack bundler to build things

we will us parcel in this - easy to configure

to install - npm install -D parcel
dev dependency - required in development, dont need parcel in prod
noraml dependency - will be used in prod

if we use ^ in dependency version - will instqall minor version
if we use ~ in dependency version - will install patch version automatically 

package-lock.json - keeps track of exact version , does not have ^ or ~, diff from package.json
integratity is a hash which helps - whatever is on my local is what is being used on prod

node modules contains all the code that we fetched from npm

transitive dependencies - a depends on b , b depends on c and so on


// to ignite the app
npx parcel index.html

parcel created a server and hosted onto it
npx - executing a package
executing parcel , index.html is the source - creates a dev build and hosts it on the server


// features of parcel
- creates dev build
- creates local server
- automatically refreshing our page - HMR - Hot Module Replacement - anthing you change in file it is reflected in server
- uses a file watching algo to do HMR - keep track of every save and rebuilds it
- also caching things so therefore faster developement server
- does image optimization 
- minify/bundle all the files for prod
- compress all the files
- uses consistent hashing 
- code splitting
- do differential bundling - so that apps run on older broswers
- diagnostics
- error handling
- can host on https
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code

// to build for prod using parcel - npx parcel buuld index.html
this will giv error because in package.json, the entry point is App.js and in command we have mentioned index.html
therefore delete the line  "main": "App.js", from package.json


// broswerslist - make compatible for older broswers
