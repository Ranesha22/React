useEffect - has 2 args 
1 callback func
2 dependancy array

when called - 
1) called after every render of that component if no depencendy array
2) if empty dependancy array empty, called on initial render and just once 
3) if dependency array is passed in then it will be called when the dependancy change.


useState - used to create local state variable inside component so never create state variables outside of components. Always use them on top

never use useState inside a condition/for lopp/fucntion  -> can create inconsistencies in react


react-router-dom in terms of error gives access to **useRouteError** , gives more info about error.


push childer acc to route
this is done using Outlet of React-router-dom
outlet will be filled with children acc to path

if using react and want to route to some other page , then never use anchor tag, because whole page gets refreshed -> navigate to new page without reloading whole page
done using **Link** 

react is know as SPA = only one page , but diff component, just changes the components , all the routing is just components

# routing in web apps - 
1) client side routing - just loads the component
2) server-side routing - make anetwork call and fetch the new .html and render it
