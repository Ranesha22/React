everything that can be donw using react can be done using html,css,js
reeact makes developer experience easy
optimizes something on webpage so that things happen very fast

react is expert in dom manupulation , so that data and ui layer are in sync
can do faster and efficient dom manupulation
is good at dom oprations

hooks - normal js utility func given to us by react, that function has some logic written behind it
#two very imp - 
1) useState  - generate state variables, maintains state of component 
state variable = special state variable, modify it with function , 
state function = keeps ui in syn with data layer, automatically refresh the ui
*whenever a state variable updates, react re-renderes a component*

how reacts works -
1) uses **reconciliation algo** - also known as react fiber - 
react creates a VIRTUAL DOM (not an actual dom) - represntation of actual dom , it is a js object

DIFF ALGO - finds diff between prev virtual dom and updated virtual dom , calcualte diff between these two virtual dom object and then update the actual dom on every render cycle

react can do efficient dom manupulation, it has a diff maniuplation and has virtual dom - ans to why react is fast
the state updating fucntion is a trigger that starts the diff algo, whenever you call it react will re-render

2) useEffect
